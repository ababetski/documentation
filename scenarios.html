HELEN SCENARIO 1
“It’s too cold to walk to the bakery today. I’ll just order on the internet. Oh, but I can’t remember the name of that one pastry with the white cream... It wasn’t cannoli... I don’t remember, but I’ll look on the website and find the picture of the one I want.”

“My son and his family are driving in from Philly tomorrow for a visit, and I want to order pizza to be delivered just before they get here. I don’t know off the top of my head what the bakery pizza costs or how far in advance I need to place the order, so I better check the website to find out.”

“My son’s birthday is next week, and I want to order him a chocolate cake—his favorite. He’s been asking for a Despicable Me cake. I’ll go online and see if the bakery has that in their catalog.”

“My wife’s too sick to go to church today, and I’ve got a lot to do, so the kids and I are staying home too. But since they’re whining about not going to the bakery, I’ll go online and order some cupcakes. I’m in the mood for something sweet too, but I always get the same things. I’ll check if they have any specials.”

PERFORMED ON CURRENT WEBSITE
HELEN SCENARIO 1
There are limited pictures of products on the current website. There is only a text list of the products, which can be unhelpful if you don’t remember the name of the thing you want, or if you don’t recognize a name and are not sure what that product is.
<br>
<br>
HELEN SCENARIO 2
It is difficult to even find the pizza on the website, because it is under the Fundraisers tab. There are no prices, and it doesn’t specify how far in advance an order should be placed.
<br>
<br>
MIKE SCENARIO 1
The bakery currently does not have their cake catalog online. I’ve seen the physical one in their store, but it is not on the website. 
<br>
<br>
MIKE SCENARIO 2
The specials section is difficult to find on the current website. It shows up as a secondary navigation bar on the inner pages.
