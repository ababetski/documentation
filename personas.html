Owned technology: desktop computer
About: Helen, longtime resident of Nanticoke, PA, enjoys trips to Sanitary Bakery a couples times a week to pick out her favorite sweets. Buying from the bakery is affordable and convenient, saving her the trouble of baking for herself. Her reasons for going to the bakery are also personal; her earliest memory is of having her first donut at Sanitary to celebrate her father’s return from the Korean war. Having grown up in an era when local businesses were an integral part of daily life, Helen is a loyal Sanitary customer. Lately, however, she has been having trouble getting down to the store as often as she would like. After a nasty fall on the icy sidewalk last winter, Helen underwent surgery to have her hip replaced. She now uses a cane anytime she leaves home, but the three blocks from her house to the bakery have become a difficult walk. She doesn’t own a vehicle, opting instead to walk or take the bus to do her errands. Unfortunately, the bus doesn’t have a route that runs near her house to the bakery. Helen would benefit from the convenience of online ordering and local delivery from the bakery. She has a desktop computer with internet access at home, which she mainly uses to check her email, store photos of her grandkids, and read online newspapers. Helen would use an online ordering service from the bakery if the interface guided her clearly through the steps.

About: Mike, husband and father of two young children, lives in Nanticoke and brings his family to Sanitary Bakery every Sunday after they go to church. He has also purchased birthday cakes for his kids and wife there. However, Mike has a busy schedule, and he likes to do as much work as he can from his devices. He would love to be able to order goodies from the bakery, especially the cakes, without having to make a trip. Ultimately, he wants the same things Helen wants from the website: simplicity and ease. He needs a website designed with his goal in mind—online ordering—that quickly puts him in the right place and makes placing an order simple.
