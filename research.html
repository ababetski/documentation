ABOUT THE BAKERY
Sanitary Bakery is a small, family-owned store in the city of Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. Boasting the claim of “the oldest bakery in northeast PA,” it is very popular with locals, especially those who have fond childhood memories of picking out treats with their noses pressed against the glass display cases. Known simply as “Sanitary” in conversation, the bakery produces a wide selection of freshly baked goods daily. Donuts, cupcakes, giant cookies, brownies, eclairs, danishes, bagels, bread, and even more—the mouth-watering lineup makes it hard to walk out of the store with less than one box. But hey, if you want to get greedy with the goodies, your wallet won’t judge you. Sanitary’s low prices offer no obstacle to stocking up on their sweets.

KEY DEMOGRAPHICS
Sanitary appeals to a wide range of people, but there are two key demographics I’ve seen there on a regular basis. First are the patrons who are in the 65+ age range. These are the ones who remember what the store was like decades ago, and they can’t imagine ever going elsewhere for their baked goods. A website made with them in mind might offer online ordering and delivery, so that the customer doesn’t need to leave his/her home, This would be especially popular in the winter, allowing this older clientele to avoid the inconvenience of snow and ice. However, since this age group uses the internet less than other adults, the website design must be simple, with ample signposts and clear wording to guide the viewer through the pages, as well as highly visible text and buttons to make up for poor eyesight.

The second target demographic is comprised of parents, ages 25-34, who bring their young children to the bakery, often after church on Sunday morning (which, by the way, is the busiest time at Sanitary every week). It’s likely that these parents lived in or near Nanticoke growing up, and they’re continuing a tradition. Pleasing them will be different from pleasing the older demographic. When this tech-savvy age group peruses your site, they are scanning and scrolling quickly, and they require meaningful content above all else. If what you have to say or show is not better than your competitors’ offerings, they will go elsewhere, because they can. So imbue your pages with meaning. Sprinkle each one with helpful headings and links. Show off high-quality photos that relate to the topic. Tickle their fancy with novelty by offering them a “Features” page that showcases your current specials. Convince them that this is an opportunity for sweetness that they just can’t miss out on.

While those are the two demographics I have seen at the bakery as regular customers, there are two other groups who would be just as likely to use the site, if not more so. The first would be those who are looking to order a specialty cake from the bakery, and the second would be those interested in ordering pizza, especially if it’s for a big event like a fundraiser. For customers hoping to have a cake made, the website should offer an extensive gallery of cakes that have been made in the past. For both groups, an online order form would be ideal.

PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT SITE
The current site is flooded with content and cluttered by poor typography. It lacks consistent navigation and makes it difficult for readers to know where they are on the site.

COMPETITORS’ SITES
Some of Sanitary’s competitors in the area are Buttonwood Bakery, Bakehouse, Amberdonia Bakery, Bakery Delite, and Truly Scrumptious Cake Studio.
<br>
<br>
Buttonwood Bakery, the nearest in location to Sanitary, has a modern responsive website with a fairly standard layout. The navigation is consistent from page to page, and it even becomes fixed to the top upon scrolling. The online order page has visually appealing photographs, a name and a brief description for each product, prices, and customer reviews.
<br>
<br>
Bakehouse uses a warm color scheme that calls to mind freshly-baked bread. More importantly, though, their content is organized, with each heading of their navigation corresponding to exactly what you find on that page. Like Buttonwood, their website is responsive, which is really non-negotiable in 2017.

<br>
Amberdonia Bakery has a few issues with their site. One problem with their menu page—not necessarily from a reader’s perspective, but from the perspective of the site owner—is that the menu exists as an image, not as text. SEO relies on text on the page, so this choice negatively affects the site’s findability. Another major issue is this scenario: There is a tab in the main navigation that says “Pizza”...but I want to see their bakery products. So I check a  different tab, “Cookies”...but those are just a few photos of cookies. Where are the rest of their bakery products? Did I misunderstand? Maybe they just do pizza. I’m looking for bakery products, so I leave their site and won’t be back. What I didn’t realize was that “Pizza” was the first of a list of items, including bakery items, in a dropdown menu, but unless I hovered over it, there was no way to tell. It took me a minute to figure that out, and 60 seconds is an eternity, more than enough time to lose a potential customer.

Bakery Delite’s non-responsive site has some pages that are uncluttered and present some of the information you’re looking for, like their “Breads, Rolls, and Bagels” page that has a tidy, comprehensive list of products. What I would like to see throughout their website are links from one page to another, guiding their readers to do what they want them to do. Another thing I like is that they have a gallery page for wedding cakes; however, it could really use more styling, and the images should be large, not thumbnails.

I was surprised that Truly Scrumptious Cake Studio’s site is not responsive, because the overall look of the site is very modern and professional, by far the most visually pleasing of the bunch. All the right elements are in place: consistent navigation, logo takes you back to index, nicely executed photo grid, social media links—it’s all where it should be. The navigation does use some non-standard wording, but it all seems to work within their brand. One detail I loved was the inclusion of short testimonials in a sidebar under the contact form on some of the pages. One thing I did not love, however, was the slow loading of the site in general. I checked to make sure it wasn’t just my Wifi, but since other websites loaded speedily, it’s clear that the Truly Scrumptious site was at fault. Someone didn’t compress those gorgeous high-res photos!
